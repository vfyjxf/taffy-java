# Taffy-Java

A pure Java implementation of the [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) UI layout library, supporting CSS Flexbox, Grid, and Block layout algorithms.

The Java port delivers performance comparable to Rust in standard scenarios,
but experiences a noticeable drop under extreme conditions (based on benchmarks against the Rust version).

It passes the full Taffy test suite (ported to Java).

**This Java port was facilitated by AI.**
